# Phone
Simple Phone app implemented using AIDL with dialer, recents, favorites and contacts using SQLite Database and Content Provider.
This repository contains two applications namely PhoneHMI and PhoneService.
PhoneHMI refers to the client side application and PhoneService refers to the server side application.
Clone this reopository and open the both aplications seperately.
Run the PhoneService application first, which shows a blank activity.
Then run the PhoneHMI application, which is where the User interacts with the application.
